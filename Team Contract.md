# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
Our team will meet twice a week. Right now, we have agreed to meet every Tuesday at 8PM CST over Zoom, and on that Tuesday, we are going to plan which day we are going to meet once more. We are doing it this way because every week is different for us. Meetings are going to be at least one hour. Kanchan will take notes and put them in our shared folder in Google Drive. 
2. **Assistance** 
We are using iMessage to communicate; we all have notifications on and respond quickly to one another. You should be expected to respond within the day (in case you have exams or something important). 
3. **Respect** 
We already introduced ourselves to one another to better understand each other’s backgrounds. Everyone can join into the conversation when we are having team meetings and have their opinions listened to by making sure we don’t interrupt each other. We can also agree with or disagree with ideas from an objective perspective. To engage with the thoughts of others, we all agreed to actively participate in the group project and continue to generate new ideas. 
## Collaboration
4. **Work Distribution** 
We are going to assign workload by first creating a list of tasks that need to be finished after writing the project proposal. Then, we are going to ask each other what we want to do for the tasks each week depending on our exam schedule for the specific week. In addition to identifying the strengths and desires of each team member when distributing work, we are going to ask our team members what their schedule is like during the week. To address unexpected complications or unforeseen work, we are going to get it resolved as soon as possible and if we are unable to do so, we are going to attend office hours to meet with a TA. 
5. **Time Commitment** 
We are going to expect 4 hours a week from each group member for a total time commitment of 16 hours per week. For prior time commitments that need to be accounted for, during our Tuesday meetings, we are going to ask each other what our week looks like. To address new conflicts or commitments when they do inevitably occur, we would devote extra time to the project if one of us is not able to commit 4 hours a week. In that way the time commitment would balance itself out.
6. **Conflict Resolution** 
In order to resolve situations where there is disagreement among members, we are going to analyze the pros and cons of the situation and decide objectively as a group as to how we are going to resolve the situation. In a situation where one or more members have not done their jobs, we are going to kindly ask them if there is anything else that is preventing them from doing so. I think we are all pretty accommodative and understanding people, but we also need to keep the project’s goals and due date. If one or more members are habitually late, we can kindly tell them to arrive on time to our weekly meetings. If it continues to be a problem then I think it is okay to talk with the course staff. We do agree that we should try to resolve any issues among ourselves before taking it to coursestaff to also show our ability to participate in conflict resolution.
